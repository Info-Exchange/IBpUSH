## Prompts

The following prompts are from version _2B_, which may be different from your essay prompts. Please keep in mind that prompts may vary significantly, so please study all materials, not just the ones related to these prompts.

**⚠️ The following prompts are not 100% accurate, especially the first one since I didn't understand it...**

1. > How did progressive policies further democracy in the United States?
2. > To what extent did America's role in the world influence its foreign policies?

So as mentioned before, this is not what was written exactly on the papers, but the they should give you an idea on what was tested. I personally chose the 2nd prompt due to its flexibility and ability for me to mention events from both chapter 19 and 21 to support my claim.

## Possible Topics (#2)

For the second prompt, here's what you could've written down as evidence to support your claim. **Note that this is not a complete list, and what I have here is not necessarily correct. In fact, some of these might not even fit the prompt. This is just to give you an idea on the topics available.**

Here's some quick explanations for each of the topics on how they might relate to the prompt:

### Spanish-American War, Philippines Purchase & -American War

The Spanish-American War resulted in the Amerian purchase of the Philippines, and is also a show of force to the world that the United States is a potential world power. This shows the increased military power of the United States, and more importantly, further geographical expansion of the United States, allowing for more influence. This is part of the foreign policy that America had for the Pacific and Asia.

### Annexation of Hawaii

This is fairly obvious just like the previous one, both establishing America as an increasing imperial and world power, and also furthering the foreign policy of the United States in the Pacific by acquiring more land and influence.

### Open Door Policy

This policy established America's goals in China and more broadly Asia, where countries trading with China are guaranteed equal privileges. It's pretty clear why the U.S. would want this, it would expand the U.S.'s markets and influence in the region, achieving economic boosts back home but also power abroad.

### Panama Canal & Roosevelt Corollary

Connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific, this canal would be a choke point in Latin America. The U.S.'s shifting role to become a world police led to the reaffirmation of the Monroe Doctorine, and the Roosevelt Corollary, which would allow the U.S. to intervene in Latin America. This is a clear example of the U.S. expanding its influence and power abroad.

### Dollar Diplomacy & More

An extension of the new Latin America policies, this allowed the U.S. to gain control over the national fiscal affairs of Latin American countries in exchange for loans. There are many other examples like this, you can find all of them in chapter 19.

### Submarine Warfare

One of the major reasons (not really) that the U.S. joined the Great War (WWI), as Germany sunk many American merchant ships. This of course was not liked by the Americans, and with a stronger Navy now on the way (Naval Act of 1916), the U.S. was ready to intervene in this European conflict. This, although didn't change the role of America directly, did influence U.S. foreign policies towards the Central Powers.

### Zimmerman Telegram, Trade with Allies & Central Powers

You know what happened here, now that Americans no longer trust the Germans, public opinion quickly led to the decrease in trade with Germany and the Central Powers by 99%, while America tripled trade with the Allies. This is a clear example of how America's role in the world, in this case, a strong economic and military power, influenced its foreign policies.

### League of Nations & Treaty of Versailles

The end of the war saw the creation of the League of Nations, heavily pushed by Wilson, as a result of the roles of America being the world police, its global military power, strongest industrial economy, and its influence abroad. The Treaty of Versailles was also a result of the U.S.'s role in the world and more importantly the war, as it was one of the Big Four, heavily influencing the treaty.

## Conclusion

This was around the same compared the the Unit 1 essay for me. Compared to other things in life, this is nothing to stress about. This score will be so statistically insignificant in your life that it should just be treated like a regular essay that you'd write for homework. Hope this helped in one way or another, and good luck with your essay.
